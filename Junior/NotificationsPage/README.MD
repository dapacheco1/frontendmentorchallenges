# Notifications Page

Notifications page is a page of notifications that will receive in a social media network app. This page expose the many types of notifications that users receive on it and how they interact with this page.

## Challenge
In this challenge the goal is to copy the design as same as posible with many interactions. I didn't use the starter files. You will find the basic design system in additional page of project(Any feedback are welcome).

## How I solve it
First of all i realize an analysis of the page. I use some tools like color picker from chrome dev tools to know color palette.
Then i use WhatFont Chrome extension to know typography info and other features.

In this case i use flexbox layout for each element and i setting up the basic styles to work with rem measures.

After i finished de UI design i undestanding how interactions works and change. For example: When users click on not viewed notifications, it's changes the background color, disappear the red little button and notifications counter reduce one by one.
Another feature is when you click on **mark all as read** all pending notifications change their status to seen and notifications counter instantly be zero.

## Achieved knowledge

- How to use rem measures.
- How to align items on flex.
- How to use margin auto measures.
- How to analyze design and reply it.
- Determinate user interactions for a given mockup without interactions brief.
